# Preface

I created these notes when working through *Regression and Other Stories*, by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. I have tried to summarize the main points in each chapter, and provide additional explanations for topics I found difficult. Although most of the code examples are written in a base R style, I have tried to write my versions of the code examples using Tidyverse packages.

I would be delighted if other people find these notes useful. Corrections and suggestions via pull request are welcome!

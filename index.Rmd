# Preface

I created these notes when working through *Regression and Other Stories*, by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. Each chapter summarizes the main points, and provide additional explanations for topics I found difficult. Although the authors wrote most of their code in base R style, I have written my code examples using Tidyverse packages.

I would be delighted if other people find these notes useful. Corrections and suggestions via pull request are welcome!
